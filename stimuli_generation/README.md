A. If you'd like to generate your own stimuli from the Visual Genome dataset

1. Download Part 1 and Part 2 of the Visual Genome dataset: https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ranjay/visualgenome/api.html
2. Unzip and place all the images as a long list, into one "visual_genome_data" folder.
3. In config.py under the variable "VG_IMAGE_ROOT" write the path to that folder - it will serve as your stimulus generation foundation.
